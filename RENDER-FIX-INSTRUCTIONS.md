# 🔧 RENDER 404 FIX - Follow These Steps

## The Problem
Your SPA works on the home page but shows 404 errors when you:
- Refresh any page (like `/services` or `/about`)  
- Navigate directly to any URL
- Share links to specific pages

## ✅ SOLUTION - Choose ONE Method:

### METHOD 1: Dashboard Configuration (Recommended)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your static site service
3. Click **"Redirects/Rewrites"** tab
4. Click **"Add Rule"**
5. Add this rewrite rule:
   - **Source:** `/*`
   - **Destination:** `/index.html`
   - **Action:** **Rewrite** (NOT Redirect!)
   - **Status Code:** `200`
6. Click **"Save"**
7. **Deploy** your site again

### METHOD 2: Update render.yaml (Already Done)
- Push the updated `render.yaml` file to your repository
- Render will automatically apply the rewrite configuration
- **No manual dashboard setup needed**

## 🎯 What This Does:
- When someone visits `/services` → Render serves `index.html` 
- Your React app then loads and shows the Services page
- The URL stays as `/services` in the browser
- **All your routes now work perfectly!**

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Use **"Rewrite"** not "Redirect" (keeps the URL unchanged)
- Static files (CSS, JS, images) are served normally
- Only non-existing paths get rewritten to index.html

## 🚀 Result:
✅ `/` works  
✅ `/services` works  
✅ `/packages` works  
✅ `/about` works  
✅ `/contact` works  
✅ `/blog` works  
✅ Page refreshes work  
✅ Direct URLs work  
✅ Shared links work  

**Your SPA routing will be 100% functional!**
